            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Peace was one of the Bleſsings of my Fathers Government; a mercy after ſo long a Civil War, and in the midſt of ſo great Diviſion which that War bred, is not uſually afforded by God unto a People in ſo great a meaſure.</p>
            <p>The Cauſe of God, and theſe Nations, which he was ingaged in, met in all the parts of it, as you well know, with many enemies and great oppoſition; The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, privily and openly, ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, yet his Bow aboad in ſtrength, and the Arms of his hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>

As to himſelf, He died full of days, ſpent in great and ſore Travail; yet his eyes were not waxed dim, neither was his natural ſtrength abated, as it was ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> He was ſerviceable even to the laſt.</p>
            <p>As to theſe Nations, He left them in great Honor abroad, and in full Peace at home: all <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> dwelling ſafely, every man under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree, from <hi>Dan</hi> even to <hi>Beer ſheba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is gone to Reſt, and we are entred into his Labors; and if the Lord hath ſtill a Bleſſing for theſe Lands (as I truſt he hath) as our Peace hath been lengthned out to this day, ſo ſhall we go on to reap the Fruit, and gather the Harveſt of what his late Highneſs hath ſown, and laid the foundation of.</p>

            <p>It is agreeable not onely to my Truſt, but to my Principles, to govern theſe Nations by the Advice of my two Houſes of Parliament; I finde it aſſerted in the Humble Petition and Advice which is the Corner-ſtone of this Building, and that which I ſhall adhere to) <hi>That Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments are the great Councel of the Chief Magiſtrate, in whoſe Advice both he and theſe Nations may be moſt ſafe and happy.</hi> I can aſſure you I have that eſteem of them: And as I have made it the firſt Acts of my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to call you together, ſo I ſhall further let you ſee the value I have of you, by the Anſwers that I ſhall return to the Advice that ſhall be given me by you, for the good of theſe Nations.</p>

You are come up from your ſeveral Countreys, as the Heads of your Tribes, and with hearts (I perſwade my ſelf) to conſult together their good: I can ſay I meet you with the ſame deſires, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing in my deſign, but the maintenance of the Peace, Laws, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both Civil and Chriſtian, of theſe Nations; which I ſhall always make the Meaſure and Rule of my Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be ready to ſpend my life for.</p>
            <p>We have Summoned you up at this time to let you know the ſtate of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and to have your Advice in them: And I believe a Parliament was never Summoned upon a more important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>It is true, as I have told you, We are, through the goodneſs of God, at this time in Peace; but it is not thus with us becauſe we have no Enemies: there are enough both within us and without us, who would ſoon put an end to our

               <!-- PDF PAGE 35 -->Peace, were it in their powers, or ſhould it at any time come into their powers.</p>
            <p>It will be becoming your Wiſdoms to conſider of the ſecuring of our Peace againſt thoſe, who, we all know, are, and ever will be our implacable Enemies; what the means of doing this are, I ſhall refer unto you.</p>
            <p>This I can aſſure you, That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are true and faithful to the Peace and good Intereſt of theſe Nations, and it will be found ſo, and that they are a conſiſting Body, and uſeful for any good ends; and if they were not the beſt Army in the world, you would have heard of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, by reaſon of the great Arrear of Pay which is now due unto them, whereby ſome of them are reduced to great neceſſities: But you ſhall have a parti<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119010:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 35 -->I recommend it particularly to the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>You have, you know, a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> carried on by the advice of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; He is an old enemy, and a potent one, and therefore it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both for the honour and ſafety of theſe Nations, that that war be vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly proſecuted.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Conſtitution of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in all our neighbor Countreys, and round about us (as well friends as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) are very conſiderable, and calls upon us to be upon our Guard both at Land and Sea, and to be in a poſture able to maintain and conſerve our own State and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Great and powerful Fleets are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to be ſet forth into theſe Seas, and conſiderable Armies of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kings are now diſputing for the Maſtery of the <hi>Sound</hi> with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Iſlands and Countreys; among which is the Roman Emperor, with

               <!-- PDF PAGE 36 -->other Popiſh States; I need not tell you of what Conſequence theſe things are to this State.</p>
            <p>We have already interpoſed in theſe Affairs, in ſuch manner as we found it neceſſary for the intereſt of <hi>England;</hi> and matters are yet in ſuch a condition in thoſe parts, that this State may, with the aſsiſtance of God, provide that their differences may not prejudice us.</p>
            <p>The other things that are to be ſaid I ſhall refer to my Lord Keeper <hi>Fiennes,</hi> and cloſe up what I have to ſay with onely adding two or three particulars to what I have already ſaid.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I recommend to your care the People of God in theſe Nations, with their Concernments. The more they are divided among themſelves, the greater prudence ſhould be uſe to cement them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The good and neceſſary work of Reformation, both in Manners and in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, that Profaneneſs may be diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

            <p>Thirdly, I recommend unto you the Proteſtant cauſe abroad, which ſeems at this time to be in ſome danger, having great and powerful Enemies, and very few Friends; and I hope and believe that the old Engliſh zeal to that cauſe is ſtill among us.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, My Lords, and you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Houſe of Commons, That you will in all your Debates maintain and conſerve Love and Unity among your ſelves, that therein you may be the patern of the Nation, who have ſent you up in Peace, and with their Prayers, that the Spirit of Wiſdom and Peace may be among you: and this ſhall alſo be my prayer for you; and to this let us all add our utmoſt endeavors for the making this an happy Parliament.</p>
