            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Peace was one of the Ble≈øsings of my Fathers Government; a mercy after ≈øo long a Civil War, and in the mid≈øt of ≈øo great Divi≈øion which that War bred, is not u≈øually afforded by God unto a People in ≈øo great a mea≈øure.</p>
            <p>The Cau≈øe of God, and the≈øe Nations, which he was ingaged in, met in all the parts of it, as you well know, with many enemies and great oppo≈øition; The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, privily and openly, ≈øorely grieved him, and ≈øhot at him, yet his Bow aboad in ≈øtrength, and the Arms of his hands were made ≈øtrong by the hands of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>

As to him≈øelf, He died full of days, ≈øpent in great and ≈øore Travail; yet his eyes were not waxed dim, neither was his natural ≈øtrength abated, as it was ≈øaid of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> He was ≈øerviceable even to the la≈øt.</p>
            <p>As to the≈øe Nations, He left them in great Honor abroad, and in full Peace at home: all <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> dwelling ≈øafely, every man under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree, from <hi>Dan</hi> even to <hi>Beer ≈øheba.</hi>

            <p>He is gone to Re≈øt, and we are entred into his Labors; and if the Lord hath ≈øtill a Ble≈ø≈øing for the≈øe Lands (as I tru≈øt he hath) as our Peace hath been lengthned out to this day, ≈øo ≈øhall we go on to reap the Fruit, and gather the Harve≈øt of what his late Highne≈øs hath ≈øown, and laid the foundation of.</p>

            <p>It is agreeable not onely to my Tru≈øt, but to my Principles, to govern the≈øe Nations by the Advice of my two Hou≈øes of Parliament; I finde it a≈ø≈øerted in the Humble Petition and Advice which is the Corner-≈øtone of this Building, and that which I ≈øhall adhere to) <hi>That Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments are the great Councel of the Chief Magi≈øtrate, in who≈øe Advice both he and the≈øe Nations may be mo≈øt ≈øafe and happy.</hi> I can a≈ø≈øure you I have that e≈øteem of them: And as I have made it the fir≈øt Acts of my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to call you together, ≈øo I ≈øhall further let you ≈øee the value I have of you, by the An≈øwers that I ≈øhall return to the Advice that ≈øhall be given me by you, for the good of the≈øe Nations.</p>

            <p>It is true, as I have told you, We are, through the goodne≈øs of God, at this time in Peace; but it is not thus with us becau≈øe we have no Enemies: there are enough both within us and without us, who would ≈øoon put an end to our

            <p>This I can a≈ø≈øure you, That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are true and faithful to the Peace and good Intere≈øt of the≈øe Nations, and it will be found ≈øo, and that they are a con≈øi≈øting Body, and u≈øeful for any good ends; and if they were not the be≈øt Army in the world, you would have heard of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, by rea≈øon of the great Arrear of Pay which is now due unto them, whereby ≈øome of them are reduced to great nece≈ø≈øities: But you ≈øhall have a parti<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <!-- PDF PAGE 35 -->I recommend it particularly to the Hou≈øe of Commons.</p>
            <p>You have, you know, a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> carried on by the advice of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; He is an old enemy, and a potent one, and therefore it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, both for the honour and ≈øafety of the≈øe Nations, that that war be vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly pro≈øecuted.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Con≈øtitution of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in all our neighbor Countreys, and round about us (as well friends as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) are very con≈øiderable, and calls upon us to be upon our Guard both at Land and Sea, and to be in a po≈øture able to maintain and con≈øerve our own State and Intere≈øt.</p>
            <p>Great and powerful Fleets are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to be ≈øet forth into the≈øe Seas, and con≈øiderable Armies of ≈øeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kings are now di≈øputing for the Ma≈øtery of the <hi>Sound</hi> with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent I≈ølands and Countreys; among which is the Roman Emperor, with

            <p>We have already interpo≈øed in the≈øe Affairs, in ≈øuch manner as we found it nece≈ø≈øary for the intere≈øt of <hi>England;</hi> and matters are yet in ≈øuch a condition in tho≈øe parts, that this State may, with the a≈øsi≈øtance of God, provide that their differences may not prejudice us.</p>

            <p>And fir≈øt, I recommend to your care the People of God in the≈øe Nations, with their Concernments. The more they are divided among them≈øelves, the greater prudence ≈øhould be u≈øe to cement them.</p>
